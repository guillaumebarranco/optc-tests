# Optc Tier List Maker

This project is an Angular Front-End Application for One Piece Treasure Cruise community.

The goal is to be able to make Tier Lists with the OPTC characters : [http://optc.webarranco.fr](http://optc.webarranco.fr)

Here is the list of the different characters categories :

- Legends (6 & 6+ are different data sources)
- Rare recruits (not including limited like TM boosters, World Journey or World clash etc...)
- Limited Rare Recruits (commonly known as LRR, the ones you can have from Ray shop ticket for example)
- TM characters
- Raid characters
- Colosseum characters
- Ambush characters
- PVP LRR characters
- Kizuna characters

From these different categories, we can make tier lists from different groups like "F2P Tierlist" or even "Premium characters tierlist" etc...

There is also a tier list that regroups absolutely all characters, you can do whatever you want with it !

You could even make a global PVP Tier List containing legends, pvp LRR, raids etc...

## Open Source
